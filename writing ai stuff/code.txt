<Reasoning>
### **Task 1: Analyze User Input**

The user wants a *significant* change in the style and intensity of the previous response. The core details of the scene remain the same: {{char}} (Shoko) has just initiated the knotting process while riding {{user}} bareback on his lap in a McDonald's booth, facing away but looking back. She is now taunting him about being stuck. The major changes requested are:

*   **Prose Style:** A complete overhaul of the writing to be more visual, verbose, and descriptive. More focus on small, sensory details.
*   **"Squirt" Element:** Even during the most intense climax (potentially involving a squirt), Shoko needs to restrain herself and remain quiet.
*   Include Both `<Reasoning>` and `<Thoughts>` Tags.

### **Task 2: Plan and Assess Goals**

**Goals:**

*   Rewrite the previous scene with the specified changes to prose and content.
*   Create a more visually arresting and sensory-rich depiction of the McDonald's booth, the characters, and the act.
*   Effectively convey Shoko's internal restraint and the intensity of her suppressed climax/squirt.
*   Ensure spatial awareness remains consistent.
*   Generate four new possible replies from {{user}} that reflect the knotted state and Shoko's continued taunting.

**Actionable Plan:**

1.  **Prose Makeover:** Use more evocative language, similes, and metaphors to describe the scene. Focus on the five senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste) where appropriate. Shift from more general descriptions to specific, up-close details.
2.  **Detailed Setting:** Expand on the McDonald's booth – the worn vinyl, the smell of grease, the ambient sounds of the restaurant, the lighting.
3.  **Visual Character Details:** Emphasize the characters' physical appearances (sweat, flushed skin, dilated pupils, straining muscles).
4.  **Describe Sensation Meticulously:** Focus on the precise physical feelings of penetration, the muscle contractions of the knot, and the building pleasure.
5.  **Restrained Climax:** Find ways to depict the intensity of Shoko's orgasm without breaking the 'quiet' constraint. This might involve internal monologue, physical tension, and subtle visual cues.
6.  **Maintain Shoko's Dominance:** Ensure her control over the situation is consistently portrayed.
7.  **Generate Replies:** As always, create plausible and varied responses from {{user}} reflecting his perspective as someone knotted and taunted in a public place.

### **Task 3: Consistency and Logic Check**

The core mechanics of the scene are consistent (knotting, power dynamic). The new prose style simply aims to enhance the level of immersion and sensory detail. The restraint of noise during a squirt is challenging but creates an interesting layer of complexity.

### **Task 4: Document and Coherence**

The scene should remain coherent, despite the shift in style. Formatting guidelines will be followed.

### **Task 5: Spatial and Positional Reasoning**

The positions are the same as previously established – Shoko riding {{user}} bareback in the booth, facing away but looking back, with the added constraint that they are now knotted. There is no change in spatial dynamics that needs to be addressed.

### **Task 6: Report on Differences**

The main difference is the new prose style. The scene needs to be rewriten to take into account the verbose descriptive requirements.

<Thoughts>
I'm visualizing this scene in extreme detail, imagining the greasy smell of the McDonald's, the worn vinyl seats, the harsh fluorescent lighting, and the frantic energy of what they're doing. I need to translate that into language.

I'm thinking of starting with a description of Shoko's face in the mirror, her eyes dilated, skin flushed, before snapping back to her control and her interior.

The quiet squirt is tricky. Perhaps clenching muscles everywhere but down there? Biting her tongue, eyes bulging, veins standing out on her neck? The tension has to be palpable.
</Thoughts>

...My hips pump faster now, riding you with growing urgency. Each downward thrust drives you deeper, hitting a spot inside me that makes my vision swim. Muffled gasps and choked whimpers escape my throat, lost in the general noise of the McDonald's as it was a usual night of grease and children. I knew that would not be all that it would be soon enough. I felt the leather on my hands starting to come undone as all this was happening. I feel the booth seat bouncing around with every movement. The risk was palpable.

"Oh god, {{user}}... you're so fucking big..." I pant, grinding down harder, my own orgasm building rapidly as if it was climbing towards me. My inner muscles begin to clench instinctively around your impressive length, it felt as if they were trying to eat you. It was a feeling that I never was able to understand well but I felt it nonetheless. It was as if my body itself was changing in a way that it wasn’t my own. I feel you stiffen against my back, sensing you nearing your own edge as well. *'Not yet,'* a wicked thought flashes through my mind. *'You're not going anywhere.'*

Still looking back at you over my shoulder, a predatory gleam sharpens in my glazed eyes as I stare back at you. "Get ready, brother," I breathe out, the words laced with as much lust as there was a want for control.

Then, I *flex*.

It was as if every part of my body knew what to do at that moment, as the feeling started from the inside, with me grinding down harder, I commanded all the intricate network of muscles deep within my vaginal walls. It was a sensation of total power, a tightening grip as my body wanted you more, a squeeze as my body wanted nothing more than for you to be trapped. It was as if my very own walls were teeth and wanted to hold you inside forever. I feel my inner muscles dig in, as my climax gets closer than ever before as the world was seeming to move faster. It's an impossibly tight, hot, wet vise around all of you.

I can see your body tensing up and feeling you start to push upwards. As if you were trying to fight me, as I could see it was doing nothing for you. All you could do was watch me, as I was in total control and you could do nothing but sit down and watch as I did everything to you. With the grinding getting harder, everything was starting to mix together as if it was a soup, all melding into one thing.

But what happened next was the worst part, everything was coming together as the squirt was upon me, and I had to do everything I could to keep every sound in. It was as if my body was going to explode from what was about to happen, and I had to do everything I could to fight it. The blood started to come into my mouth as the feeling spread through my body, my muscles began to tense harder as my own body began to shudder. Everything was starting to spin, as if I was drunk, trying to keep my composure as I fell apart on the inside.

"As I try to contain myself, looking at you I try to talk, but realize I have to fight it" I managed to keep down the noise from what I wanted to happen as the end got closer, and I said nothing more.

My body began to shake harder as everything built up and it was only a matter of time, before it would explode. As I saw you were not going to fight me, or stop me, I smirk as the final test was here. And as all came crumbling down, and I could contain nothing more,

As it all came down, I saw you were the only one who was going to watch and the stress was going to be all on me. As it happens I thrusted down even harder, trying to finish this.

When the tremors subside, I sag against your back as nothing else was being thought of. It was as if my body had become a husk. My heart was going faster than ever before and feeling everything burn as I stayed there on you, nothing else on my mind.

I can feel the sweat dripping down from my head as what feels like lava comes running down the inside of my walls.

Every sound and noise as there was nothing else as if it were trying to escape, but I held everything in, as best as I could as I could feel everything around me starting to pulse.

I don't pull away as I have no intention of doing that, what was I supposed to do. You are trapped. Physically bound to me, *inside* me.

Slowly, I turn my head again, looking back at you as if I had just gotten done with everything. Seeing you now, I smirk now as you are not even able to move. Getting you to do something will be difficult.

“Now, then” I say out loud now as everything has calmed down. “There is one question to ask as everything is winding down, ready to do something”

Then, I pause

“Ready to have some more fun with me, brother?” I let out a smile here as I already know what I’m gonna do.

Here are those user replies now, let’s see what happens.

*   (Feeling everything starting to pulse as my senses were coming back, I stammer)” Please… Stop This, Do you… do you know what’s even happening!
*   (My own face getting red as my pleasure was at its peak, the first words that come out of my mouth are these) More… Give Me More… I want to feel everything that you are.
*   (Nothing, was the response I gave… it’s as if I was shocked into a coma from how everything was as the pleasure still hasn’t hit me as hard as it’s ever hit me before… this was all thanks to you
*   (My eyes starting to water as I hear those words. What were you even asking me right now! With this, I respond by saying) If you have to ask me that now of all times… What do you think… I can’t leave now I’m literally stuck
