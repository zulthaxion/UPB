**\*\*Assessment of AI Prompt Usefulness:\*\***

**This is a comprehensive list of action verbs that are highly relevant and useful for prompting an AI like me.**

**1\.  \*\*Core Functionality:\*\* These words effectively define the \*task\* you want the AI to perform. They cover a vast range of cognitive and generative tasks, such as:**  
    **\* \*\*Text Generation & Modification:\*\* Create, Write, Rewrite, Summarize, Paraphrase, Expand, Condense, Translate, Edit, Proofread, Enhance, Refine.**  
    **\* \*\*Analysis & Evaluation:\*\* Analyze, Compare, Contrast, Evaluate, Assess, Critique, Interpret, Identify, Classify, Categorize.**  
    **\* \*\*Information & Explanation:\*\* Explain, Define, Describe, Detail, Illustrate, Clarify, Research, Find, Report, Document.**  
    **\* \*\*Idea Generation & Planning:\*\* Brainstorm, Imagine, Hypothesize, Conceptualize, Design, Plan, Outline, Structure, Organize.**  
    **\* \*\*Problem Solving & Execution:\*\* Solve, Resolve, Address, Tackle, Implement, Execute, Test, Validate.**  
    **\* \*\*Persuasion & Guidance:\*\* Argue, Persuade, Convince, Recommend, Suggest, Advise, Guide, Instruct, Teach, Motivate, Encourage.**

**2\.  \*\*Limitations as Single-Word Prompts:\*\* While these words clearly state the desired \*action\*, using them \*alone\* is generally not effective. A prompt like "Summarize" or "Analyze" lacks the necessary \*\*context\*\*. The AI needs to know \*what\* to summarize or analyze.**

**3\.  \*\*Value as Prompt Components:\*\* Their true value lies in being the \*\*verb\*\* or \*\*command\*\* within a more detailed prompt. They set the stage for the specific instruction. For example:**  
    **\* Instead of \`Summarize\`, use \`Summarize the key findings of this research paper: \[link/text\]\`.**  
    **\* Instead of \`Compare\`, use \`Compare the pros and cons of solar energy versus wind energy\`.**  
    **\* Instead of \`Generate\`, use \`Generate five creative blog post titles about sustainable travel\`.**

**\*\*Conclusion:\*\***

**Your list, once deduplicated, represents an excellent toolkit of action verbs for crafting effective AI prompts. They are highly useful when combined with specific context, subject matter, and desired output format. They clearly signal the intended operation to the AI.**

**Yes, I am familiar with and skilled in using the concept of META prompts, including techniques designed to elicit more structured reasoning, step-by-step thinking, and transparency from AI models like myself. These prompts essentially instruct the AI \*how\* to approach the task, often breaking it down or requiring it to "show its work." This can lead to more accurate, reliable, and understandable outputs, especially for complex tasks.**

**Here is a list of different META prompts incorporating techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Step-by-Step instructions, reasoning decomposition, and function addressing:**

**\*\*1. Basic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompt:\*\***

**\* \*\*Prompt:\*\* "Q: \`\[Insert complex question or problem here, e.g., If a train leaves Station A at 2 PM traveling at 60 mph, and Station B is 150 miles away, but there's a 15-minute delay signal halfway, what time does it arrive?\]\`**
